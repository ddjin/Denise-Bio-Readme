# Welcome!

Hi! My name is Denise, and I’m a student who is currently participating in a virtual summer electrical engineering program where I’m learning skills such as problem-solving, research, and 3d modeling. 
This experience has really helped me see how engineering is present in many disciplines and used to create effective solutions. 
After the summer, I’ll continue with a robotics course in my school which focuses on computer-aided design, career exploration, and development in technology which I’m really excited to learn. 
I’m especially interested in embedded systems and circuits, and I’m looking forward to learning more and connecting with mentors who can help guide me to starting a career in electrical engineering. 
 On Github, I hope to achieve learning more about coding and functions!
